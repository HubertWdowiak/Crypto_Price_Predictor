## Weekly plan :
   ### Week 1 (01.05 - 07.05)
Week one goal is to create cryptocurrencies database. We are going to eliminate JSON file usage for saving cryptocurrencies data in paprika_client. Instead of this we are going to directly update database. We also are going to draw charts based on data from database. What more we want to display N number of cryptocurrencies on the home page and add functionality of choosing currency that is cryptocurrency diplayed in.
   ### Week 2 (07.05 - 14.05)
Week two goal is to create dedicated subpages which will allow user to look into cryptocurrencies details. We are also going to add search mechanism on the home page. It will allow user to easily find cryptocurrency which they are interested in. Every currency on the home page will have possibility to be clicked on in order to redirecting user to the corresponding subpage.
   ### Week 3 (14.05 - 21.05) 
In week three our web app should be functional, next goal is to perfect subpages for each cryptos and write tests that will check our features.
   ### Week 4. (21.05 - 28.05) 
In week four our interface to input sum of money that user will want to invest should be in demo version. In this week we should start creating second part of our project that will focus on predicting the future course.
   ### Week 5. (01.06 - 07.06) 
In fifth week our goal will be to improve predictions of profits and losses, create mechanism that suggest user what to invest in. Also in this week we are going to make our front end a little bit nicer.
   ### Week 6. (07.06 - 15.06) 
Last few days we are going to changing the application to the "release" version, writing the last few tests, clearing the code and improving the working fluency.
